# Contributing to the DAIU Specification

Thank you for your interest in improving DAIU.

This repository is the source for the DAIU specification site at `daiu.org/spec`. All content is written in Markdown so that contributors do not need to work directly with React or Docusaurus internals.

## Ways to contribute

- Fix typos or unclear wording in the spec
- Suggest additional examples for different content types
- Improve accessibility or implementation guidance
- Help translate the spec into other languages

## How the docs are organized

- `docs/1.0` contains the DAIU 1.0 specification in English
- Future versions will live in `docs/1.1`, `docs/2.0`, etc.
- Translations live under `i18n/<language>/...` when added

## Editing a page

1. Click **"Edit this page"** on the spec site (once deployed), or
2. Open the corresponding file under `docs/1.0/` in GitHub.

Then:

- Make your changes in Markdown
- Commit to a branch in your fork
- Open a Pull Request against `main`

A maintainer will review your changes. Please keep the tone neutral and descriptive.

DAIU is intended to be used in many languages and regions.

In DAIU 1.0:

- the codes `HM`, `AG`, `None`, `Assist`, `Remix`, `Major`, `Full` and the label `DAIU 1.0` remain in their canonical English form across languages
- surrounding explanatory text can be translated

Implementations may:

- translate the words *Human Made* and *AI Generated* while keeping `HM` and `AG`
- translate notes, examples and policy language
- adapt examples to match local writing and citation norms

Translated versions of this specification should keep the same section order and structure as the English source where possible.

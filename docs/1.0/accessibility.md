DAIU is intended to support assistive technologies, not replace them.

Implementers should:

- ensure that DAIU disclosures are present as text, not only as decorative images or badges
- include relevant information in alt text, transcripts and ARIA attributes where appropriate
- avoid color only distinctions when representing DAIU levels in visual badges

Screen reader and accessibility tools may optionally parse DAIU meta tags and announce a short summary such as:

> This image includes a DAIU disclosure: Human Made, Assist level, DAIU 1.0.

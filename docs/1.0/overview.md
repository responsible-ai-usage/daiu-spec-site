DAIU (Declare AI Usage) is an open, voluntary framework for describing how AI contributed to a specific piece of content.

It is designed to:

- fit inside captions, credits and syllabi
- support policies, search tools and accessibility features
- stay neutral and non judgmental

DAIU is maintained by the Responsible AI Usage Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit dedicated to transparency and public understanding of AI usage.

A typical human facing disclosure looks like:

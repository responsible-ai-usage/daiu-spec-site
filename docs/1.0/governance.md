DAIU 1.0 is the first stable version of the standard.

Future versions will:

- keep the core concepts of origin and involvement level
- be published with clear migration notes
- use semantic style numbering (for example 1.0.1, 1.1, 2.0)

The Responsible AI Usage Foundation maintains this specification and welcomes feedback from adopters, including:

- universities and educators
- enterprises and content teams
- developers and tool makers
- accessibility and standards communities
